The Global Climate Change 

Global climate change is a hot topic in todayâ€™s world. As research is conducted, the world is learning that the effects of global climate change expand farther than and that the causes of it hit closer to home than we previously thought. We would like to look closer specifically into how food production and global climate change relate to each other. 

Using data sets, we will discover how closely global climate change and what we eat are related.

We will explore: 
The agricultural effects of global climate change regarding farming conditions.

The direct effects of the agricultural system on global climate change.

The residual effects of global climate change affecting access to food, healthcare, and quality of life.
