# The Global Climate Change

Global climate change is a hot topic in today’s world. As research is conducted, the world is learning that the effects of global climate change expand farther than and that the causes of it hit closer to home than we previously thought. We would like to look closer specifically into how food production and global climate change relate to each other. 

Using data sets, we will discover how closely global climate change and what we eat are related.

## We will explore:
The agricultural effects of global climate change regarding farming conditions.

The direct effects of the agricultural system on global climate change.

The residual effects of global climate change affecting access to food, healthcare, and quality of life.

## Global Temperature 
Global temperature is rising at an accelerating rate, there is data begginning in the 1800s. This is due to greenhouse gas emissions, buildup from human activity, mainly the burning of fossil fuels. 

The earth’s temperature has risen by an average of 11 degrees Fahrenheit per decade since 1850, or about 2 degrees total. The extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperatures extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals- expanding some and shrinking others. 
To calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend. 

### Reasons global temperature is important and how it affects the prices of beef

Beef production is becoming more efficient, but forests are still being cut down for new pasture as meat consumption is on the rise. 

Ruminant animals have lower growth and reproduction rates than pigs and poultry, so they require a higher amount of feed per unit of meat produced. 

Animal feed requires land to grow, which has a carbon cost associated with that. 
Beef is more resource-intensive to produce than most other kinds of meat, and animal-based foods overall are more resource-intensive than plant-based foods. 

Beef requires 20 times more land and emits 20 times more GHG emissions per gram of edible protein than common plant proteins, such as beans. 

Majority of the world’s grasslands cannot grow crops or trees, such “native grasslands” are already heavily used for livestock production, meaning additional beef demand will likely increase pressure on forests.

COVID-19 threw a curveball and caused a surge in the prices of key cattle feed ingredients like soy, corn, and wheat. As a result, farmers are struggling  to support more cattle, leading to scarcity and subsequently driving up beef prices. 

Current research shows climate change has caused more frequent large rainfall events coupled with months of zero precipitation. This volatility has made relying on typical weather patterns and grazing conditions difficult for the nations beef producers. The more volatility the country is, coupled with the inconsistent droughts, the fewer the beef cattle to graze and this short supply available to meat processing companies nationwide. 
	
#### Reasons global temperature is important and how it affects the prices of pork. (very similar to beef) 
 
Climate change can directly affect the price of pork through various channels. For example  extreme weather events impacting feed crops. Disease outbreaks affecting livestock, and increased production costs due to changes in temperature and weather patterns. 

These factors can contribute to fluctuations in pork prices, the impact can vary depending on regional conditions and other market factors. 

The pork price production has been negatively affected by climate change and global warming causing increased energy costs for cooling and ventilation, increased cost of feed energy and protein because of lowered crop production due to extreme weather conditions.



#### What are the global efforts to address climate change?
President Biden and Vice President Harris have set out some groundbreaking goals
a. Reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030
b. Reaching 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035
c. Achieving a net-zero emission economy by 2050
d. Delivering 40 percent of the benefits from federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities.
• Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act – the most significant legislation in U.S. history to tackle the climate crisis and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In addition, new investments in U.S. clean energy manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and clean power projects have reached over $390 billion dollars. 

#### Efforts of management options to use less energy and cope with extreme weather?
a. Renovation of and building new structures: for ventilation, consider the use of centrifugal fans rather than axial fans in applications where possible, as they are more efficient, work better against external wind forces, and are easier to maintain.
b. Increase structural strength and insulation of buildings to withstand higher winds and manage extreme temperatures.
c. Utilize natural light when possible and LED light bulbs when artificial light is needed.
d. Utilize creep boxes in a farrowing unit so lower overall building temperature can be kept lower.
e.Install solar panels for energy usage 
f.Consider outdoor or partial outdoor finishing to save energy
